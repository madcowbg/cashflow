# Cashflow: an Economic Scenario Generator for FIRE

# Manifesto

## Assumptions

The app embodies the following assumptions:

* Current market value is a faulty measure of retirement portfolios and portfolio health.
* The intrinsic value of investment securities
    * is driven by:
        * the current cashflow generated by the security.
        * growth of the security cashflow.
    * is fairly stable and forecastable over long terms. [TODO cite articles]
* The market price is driven by, in addition the intrinsic value, also the discount rate of future cashflows, which:
    * is driven by:
        * inflation and inflation expectations.
        * market sentiment.
    * is very unstable and produces the market crashes and bubbles we all know and love.

Research shows [TODO cite] that long-term growth fairly closely follows the intrinsic value. The Gordon equation implies
a long-term equity market return equal to:

![Gordon equation](<https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?mr = cdy + dg + infl>),

where mr is the market return, cdy is the current dividend yield, dg is the (real) dividend growth and infl is the
realized inflation.

The Gordon equation provides a fairly accurate picture, if we also take into account that over time market sentiment has
shifted to demand lower returns over time, realized as capital gains by increasing the share price compared with the
dividends.

Both the intrinsic value and the discount rate evolve over time. The standard way to think about risk focuses on the
short-term, where the discount rate reigns supreme and drowns all in noise. As a consequence, most people simply assume
a fixed rate of growth of their portfolio, sprinkle a bit of volatility and call that analysis. This view is,
regrettably, wholly deficient in both extreme environments, where market valuations can get a bit out of whack, and a
fixed future growth rate is unrealistic.

[comment]: <> (TODO environments of sustained bull markets, when the discount rate volatility gets ridiculously low and
consequently future returns should be low)

The goal of the application is to provide a convenient way to visualize, analyze and simulate the long-term behavior of
investment portfolios based on their cashflows.

## Dividends

There is a recent-ish resurgence of the cargo cult masquerading as investing that assumes that dividends are not
important. Quite the opposite, dividends, and especially the long-term expectation of dividends is what allows
investment assets to have quantitative value.

There is a paradox that dividends themselves are fairly stable over time, and their volatilities are order of magnitude
lower than the volatility of the stock market. This means that dividends forecasts are more stable and accurate than market movement forecasts.

In this application the dividends are assumed to have a random realization represented by a dividend growth multiplier, which means that:

![dividend evolution formula](<https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?div_{t+1} = div_t * mult_t * (1 + growth)>)

where the multiplier is a lognormal random variable with mean of 1 and given standard deviation.

A quick review of the S&P dividends shows standard deviation of annual dividend log-change to be 0.03, so this is the default value provided.
